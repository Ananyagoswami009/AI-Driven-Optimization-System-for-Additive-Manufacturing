ðŸ”§ AI-Driven System for Smart Manufacturing with 3D Printing Optimization and Real-Time Quality Control
This project presents an end-to-end AI-powered manufacturing system that integrates 3D Printing Parameter Optimization, Real-Time Defect Detection, and Design Optimization to enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and quality of additive manufacturing processes.

Key Components:
3D Printing Parameter Optimization: Leveraged the Random Forest Regressor to model and predict optimal 3D printing parameters such as print speed, temperature, and layer height. This ensures minimal material waste, improved structural integrity, and faster production times.

Real-Time Defect Detection: Implemented the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once v8) object detection algorithm to identify and localize defects such as under-extrusion, warping, and layer shifting during the printing process. This allows for immediate corrective action, significantly reducing the rate of failed prints.

Design Optimization: Applied AI-driven techniques to iteratively refine part designs for functionality and manufacturability. This includes geometry adjustments for strength, printability, and material efficiency.

Impact:
By combining predictive modeling and computer vision, this AI system:

Enhances production reliability and throughput.

Reduces material costs through precise control and optimization.

Improves quality assurance with real-time monitoring and feedback.

This project demonstrates how advanced machine learning models and real-time analytics can transform modern manufacturing, especially in the domain of 3D printing and additive design.
